We are pursuing three interrelated research thrusts at the intersection of chemical engineering, computational chemistry, and computer science:

- **Molecular simulation and machine learning for adsorption in porous materials**
<br>
- **Modeling to characterize and separate emerging contaminants in water pollution**
<br>
- **Teaching AI agents to derive new theories in molecular science**
