We use and develop molecular simulation techniques and artificial intelligence tools to gain molecular-scale insights on processes in the environment to enable new solutions for cleaner air and water.

We are pursuing three interrelated research thrusts at the intersection of chemical engineering, computational chemistry, and computer science:



- **Molecular simulation for materials that separate contaminants from water**


- **Bringing formal theorem proving tools into science and engineering**


- **Teaching AI agents to derive new theories in molecular science**
