When reviewing a paper, try to keep the following in mind:
- Read the paper fully, making notes about what is clear and what is not.
- Note technical issues, such as
  - Are there experiments or analyses that should be done (or reframed)?
  - Do the authors describe new methods? If yes, how do these methods compare to existing methods?
- Note stylistic issues, such as
  - are the figures and accompanying legends clear?
  - Spelling/grammar errors
  - Are acronyms used excessively and without justifiable reason?
  - Are there any missing or incorrect citations?

When formatting a first draft of a review, create two sections, one focused on the *Major Points*:
- Write 2-3 sentences on the major goals of the paper
- Assess whether the paper accomplishes those goals in separate paragraphs
  - For each major goal, focus only on the major issues that deal with data quality and data interpretation
  - Each major issue should be its own paragraph
- State the major successes of the paper.
  - “The major success of the paper is in developing a new model for side chain conformational heterogeneity”.
- State the major weakness(es) of the paper (if any).
  - “The major weakness of the paper is that the model proposed is not tested”.
- Write 1-2 sentences on the place/impact of this paper in the field.

and one focused on *Minor Points*:
- List all minor technical questions you have
  - It is important that you distinguish between things you think are done incorrectly/incompletely and things that are not explained clearly enough for a reader to understand.
- List all minor stylistic issues
  - JF's tend to focus a lot on clarity, but it’s great to have a reviewer who is eagle-eyed for all issues
- Note any parts of the paper you do not feel like you are able to assess
  - "A significant part of the paper relies on a sophisticated analysis of mass spectrometry. I cannot offer expert feedback on the technical merits of this part of the paper.”
