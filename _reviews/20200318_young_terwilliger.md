abstract: "The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate the application of density modification to cryoEM. The authors have previously implemented density modification for macromolecular crystallography, and since then it has been widely used in the field of structural biology. The extension of this method to cryoEM can be expected to be similarly impactful, as several users have already attested to."
