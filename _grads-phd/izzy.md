description: Faezeh’s journey started in chemical engineering, where she earned her bachelor’s degree, and later she added an MBA to her toolkit. Now, as a Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering, she’s exploring a question that fascinates her: what if the way we draw analogies could help us predict the properties of materials? She loves mixing hands-on engineering experience with data-driven tools, always looking for new ways to connect ideas that don’t usually meet. For her, the most exciting breakthroughs come from thinking outside the box. Outside of research, she enjoys being in nature; hiking, walking by the water, or just getting some fresh air. She also loves reading, especially books on psychology and philosophy.
