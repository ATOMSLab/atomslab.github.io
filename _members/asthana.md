description:
"Pooja received her Ph.D. degree from University of Oulu, Finland. Her thesis was focused on the structural characterization of Mycobacterial membrane proteins using X-ray crystallography and SAXS.

In Fraser lab, she will utilize both X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM to study the drug complexes of tubulin and understand the molecular mechanism of resistance of anti-parasitic drugs. Outside lab, she enjoys long walks and board games.
