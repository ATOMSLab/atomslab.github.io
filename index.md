The **ATOMS Lab** within the [Department of Chemical, Biochemical and Environmental Engineering](https://https://cbee.umbc.edu/) at the University of Maryland Baltimore County is led by [Professor Tyler R. Josephson](https://cbee.umbc.edu/josephson/). We use and develop molecular simulation techniques and artificial intelligence tools to gain molecular-scale insights on processes in the environment to enable new solutions for cleaner air and water.
