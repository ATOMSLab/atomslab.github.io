The **ATOMS Lab** within the 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cbee.umbc.edu/">Department of Chemical, Biochemical and Environmental Engineering</a>
at the University of Maryland Baltimore County is led by 
<a target="_blank" href="https://cbee.umbc.edu/josephson/">Professor Tyler R. Josephson</a>. 
We use and develop molecular simulation techniques and artificial intelligence tools to gain molecular-scale insights on processes in the environment to enable new solutions for cleaner air and water.
