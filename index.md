The **ATOMS Lab** at UMBC is led by Professor <a target="_blank" href="https://cbee.umbc.edu/josephson/">Tyler R. Josephson</a>. <br>

In chemistry, the fundamental building blocks are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"> atoms</a>; from their interactions emerge molecules, materials, and their properties. In mathematical logic, fundamental assumptions are also called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_formula"> atoms</a>; from these, proofs, lemmas, and theorems are derived. <br>

The ATOMS Lab brings together chemical engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians as we equip computers to reason about and discover theories in molecular science.
