<h3>Undergraduate Students</h3>
Students majoring in Chemical Engineering and/or Computer Science are encouraged to apply.

- Previous research experience is *not* required.
- Students must be able to work an average of 10 hour per week.
- Demonstrated leadership and collaboration experience is a plus.
- Strong communication skills (written and oral) are a plus.
- For Chem E students, prior experience coding is a plus (but not required).
- For CS students, prior experience in chemistry is a plus (but not required). 

**Why do research?** <br>
Through undergraduate research, you’ll: 1) learn about the latest questions currently under scientific investigation and approaches being used to tackle them, 2) help solve real and important scientific problems, and 3) gain valuable experience in critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication.

**What will you do?** <br>
The ATOMS Lab is focused on developing and using computational chemistry and artificial intelligence tools for solving engineering problems. Undergraduate researchers will generally work on one of two tracks: 1) simulating properties of molecules, or 2) building/using AI tools for discovering Chemical Engineering theories. These may involve activities such as running molecular simulations on a supercomputer or writing/running code for AI.

**What are the hours for the position?** <br>
Apart from attendance at weekly group meetings, students are free to work according to a flexible schedule. So far during COVID, all work has been remote, though we do have a lab office under construction for future use.

**How do I apply?** <br>
If you’re interested in applying for a lab position or for research credit, you must read <a href="/static/docs/...">ATOMS Lab Undergraduate Research Agreement</a> carefully to make sure you understand what’s involved. Then include in a single email: (1) your resume (PDF), (2) unofficial copy of your transcript (PDF); freshman can send high school transcript (PDF), and (3) one page or less explaining why you’d like to work in our lab (PDF). <br>
To write this well, I suggest you look at some of our papers from the last few years to orient yourself to our current projects. Make the subject of your <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">email</a> “Undergrad Application” and send this to Prof. Josephson. 


<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
Students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. should apply to <a href="https://cbee.umbc.edu/academics/prospective-graduate-students/">UMBC CBEE doctoral programs</a>. Admission is determined by the department faculty committee where students are either admitted as *direct admits* or *general admits*.

Direct admit students have agreed to work in a particular faculty’s research lab upon their arrival at UMBC, and the faculty has agreed to serve as the student’s dissertation advisor and provide funding. 

General admit students go through research rotations in their first year, which allows students to clarify student-faculty interest and develop optimal student-faculty matches. Learn more about <a href="/static/docs/ATOMS_Lab_Rotation_Plan.pdf">rotations in the ATOMS lab</a>.

If you're interested in Ph.D. with either direct or general admit, or in thesis or project-based masters research (majoring in Chem E and/or CS), reach out to Prof. Josephson by <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">email</a> with your:  (1) CV, (2) a description of research experience and interests, and (3) specific information about why the ATOMS Lab interests you.
<br>

<h3>Postdoctoral Fellows</h3>
Interested postdocs should <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">email</a> directly to Prof. Josephson with CV and statement of your research interests and background.

**Student testimonials:** <br>
*“To me, the best part of working in ATOMS Lab is that I can work closely with Dr. Josephson. The guidance as well as insights from him keep me moving forward to the research goal. Beside research, we also have different activities and workshops to provide students with soft skills to enhance their potential. Last but not least, the lab environment is very friendly and supportive; lab members always offer help to others so we work as a team rather than a competition. I feel very happy to be a part of ATOMS Lab.”* – Neil Tran, B.S. Chemical Engineering, 2021
