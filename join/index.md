### Undergraduate Students 
Undergraduate students looking for research opportunities for pay or credit should <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">email </a> to Prof. Tyler R.

### Graduate Students
Graduate students should apply directly to<a href="https://cbee.umbc.edu/academics/prospective-graduate-students/"> UMBC CBEE doctoral programs</a>. Students are either admitted as “direct admits” or “general admits.”

Direct admit students have agreed to work in a particular faculty’s research lab upon their arrival at UMBC, and the faculty has agreed to serve as the student’s dissertation advisor and provide funding. 

General admit students go through research rotations in their first year, which allows students to clarify student-faculty interest and develop optimal student-faculty matches. Learn more about <a href="/static/docs/ATOMS_Lab_Rotation_Plan.pdf">rotations in the ATOMS lab</a>.
