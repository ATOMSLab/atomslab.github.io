Our lab welcomes applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver and family commitments, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status. Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative lab environment.

<h3>The ATOMS Lab is hiring!</h3>

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">We have two fully-funded PhD positions, to start in Spring 2025 or sooner.</span> Applications will be reviewed starting November 1. To apply send resume/CV, unofficial transcript, research statement, and 1-2 page letter describing your interest in the ATOMS Lab to <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">atoms@umbc.edu</a>. Specify which project below most interests you (and why), and what degree you would be pursuing at UMBC. Prof. Josephson will be at AIChE in San Diego if you’d like to meet! 

The ATOMS Lab develops new algorithms for artificial intelligence and molecular simulations. Learn more about our supportive culture and our lab policies <a target="_blank" href="/static/docs/ATOMS_Lab_Policies.pdf"> here</a>. We’re based in the Department of Chemical, Biochemical, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, just outside of Baltimore and about an hour north of Washington, DC. 

**1.	Simulation methods for multicomponent adsorption of water pollutant** <br>
This PhD student (Chemical or Environmental Engineering) will learn Monte Carlo simulations, develop new algorithms, implement them in open-source simulation software, and apply them to predict adsorption of water pollutants. This person will develop simulation workflows that extend <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00236">our method</a> for predicting adsorption of pollutants at ppb concentrations. They will also incorporate machine learning-based force fields into Monte Carlo simulation software and develop new Monte Carlo moves for reactive chemisorption.

Preferred qualifications and attributes: 
- Passionate about research in the chemical sciences and engineering
- BS and/or MS and/or PhD in Chemical or Environmental Engineering
- Prior experience with software development; strong coding skills
- Prior experience with molecular simulations and/or machine learning (optional)
- Enjoys math and problem solving
- Strong written communication skills
- Detail-oriented; strong organization and time management skills


**2.	Logic and LLMs for Evaluating Scientific Claims** <br>
This PhD student (Chemical Engineering or Computer Science) will join an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and linguists, to build an AI system for evaluating scientific claims. The ATOMS Lab brings experience in simulations and formal logic for science and engineering. This PhD student will learn to write proofs and programs in Lean 4 (check out our free online course, if you’re interested!), and will develop new ways to interface LLMs with logical reasoning tools. 

Preferred qualifications and attributes:
- Passionate about research in science and engineering
- Undergraduate and/or graduate preparation to pursue a chemical engineering or computer science PhD; minor / double major in mathematics highly preferred, and/or amateur fascination with math proofs 
- Prior coding experience, especially using LLMs with APIs; experience with Lean is a plus
- Effective collaborator and communicator
- Strong written communication skills
- Detail-oriented, strong organization and time management skills

<h3>Undergraduate Students</h3>
Students majoring in Chemical Engineering and/or Computer Science are encouraged to apply.

- Previous research experience is *not* required.
- Students must be able to work an average of 10 hour per week.
- Demonstrated leadership and collaboration experience is a plus.
- Strong communication skills (written and oral) are a plus.
- For Chem E students, prior experience coding is a plus (but not required).
- For CS students, prior experience in chemistry is a plus (but not required). 

**Why do research?** <br>
Through undergraduate research, you’ll: 1) learn about the latest questions currently under scientific investigation and approaches being used to tackle them, 2) help solve real and important scientific problems, and 3) gain valuable experience in critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication.

**What will you do?** <br>
The ATOMS Lab is focused on developing and using computational chemistry and artificial intelligence tools for solving engineering problems. Undergraduate researchers will generally work on one of two tracks: 1) simulating properties of molecules, or 2) building/using AI tools for discovering Chemical Engineering theories. These may involve activities such as running molecular simulations on a supercomputer or writing/running code for AI.

**What are the hours for the position?** <br>
Apart from attendance at weekly group meetings, students are free to work according to a flexible schedule. 

**How do I apply?** <br>
If you’re interested in applying for a lab position or for research credit, you must read <a target="_blank" href="/static/docs/ATOMS Lab_student_expectations.pdf">ATOMS Lab Undergraduate Research Agreement</a> carefully to make sure you understand what’s involved. Then include in a single email: (1) your resume (PDF), (2) unofficial copy of your transcript (PDF); freshman can send high school transcript (PDF), and (3) one page or less explaining why you’d like to work in our lab (PDF). <br>
To write this well, I suggest you look at some of our papers from the last few years to orient yourself to our current projects. Make the subject of your <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">email</a> “Undergrad Application” and send this to Prof. Josephson. 


<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
Students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. should apply to <a target="_blank" href="https://cbee.umbc.edu/academics/prospective-graduate-students/">UMBC CBEE doctoral programs</a>. Admission is determined by the department faculty committee where students are either admitted as *direct admits* or *general admits*.

Direct admit students have agreed to work in a particular faculty’s research lab upon their arrival at UMBC, and the faculty has agreed to serve as the student’s dissertation advisor and provide funding. 

General admit students go through research rotations in their first year, which allows students to clarify student-faculty interest and develop optimal student-faculty matches. Learn more about <a target="_blank" href="/static/docs/ATOMS_Lab_Rotation_Plan.pdf">rotations in the ATOMS lab</a>.

If you're interested in Ph.D. with either direct or general admit, or in thesis or project-based masters research (majoring in Chem E and/or CS), reach out to Prof. Josephson by <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">email</a> with your:  (1) CV, (2) a description of research experience and interests, and (3) specific information about why the ATOMS Lab interests you.
<br>

<h3>Postdoctoral Fellows</h3>
If you're interested in a postdoc position, reach out to Prof. Josephson by <a href="mailto:tjo@umbc.edu">email</a> with your CV and statement of research interests and background.

**Student testimonials:** <br>
*“To me, the best part of working in ATOMS Lab is that I can work closely with Dr. Josephson. The guidance as well as insights from him keep me moving forward to the research goal. Beside research, we also have different activities and workshops to provide students with soft skills to enhance their potential. Last but not least, the lab environment is very friendly and supportive; lab members always offer help to others so we work as a team rather than a competition. I feel very happy to be a part of ATOMS Lab.”* – Neil Tran, B.S. Chemical Engineering, 2021
